## Additional info

#### React Storybook
This library uses [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/) to render components in a development sandbox. In order to view the storybook, run `yarn run storybook` and navigate to the localhost port indicated.

*Every new component added to this library should be accompanied by a new story in the storybook.*

When pull requests are submitted, a Heroku review app will be deployed containing the revised storybook so that reviewers can view the changes made. When these changes are merged into `master`, the new storybook will be automatically deployed to http://lp-components.herokuapp.com.

#### DateInput styles

The `DateInput` component requires special styles in order to render correctly. These styles most be imported from the `react-datepicker` folder in `node_modules` and imported into your sass. To do this, make the following changes to your `webpack.config.js` and `application.scss`:

#### `webpack.config.js`:

Add a line near the top of the file specifying the path to the `react-datepicker` styles:

`const datePickerPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules/react-datepicker/src/stylesheets')`

Then, add this path to the `includePaths` array of the sass loader:
```
{
    test: /.scss$/,
    loader: "sass",
    query: { includePaths: [ ... , datePickerPath ] }
}
```

#### `application.scss`:

Import the `react-datepicker` styles by adding this line:

`@import "datepicker";`
