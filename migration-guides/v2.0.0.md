# v2.0.0 Migration Guide

There are three breaking changes in this version:

1. `objectify()` has been renamed to `serializeOptions()`
2. The deprecated `submit` component has been removed
3. Props for `Textarea` input component have changed:
  - `maxLength` now defaults to `false`. Provide a number to implement a maximum number of characters.
  - `showCharacterCount` has been renamed to `hideCharacterCount`
  - `hideCharacterCount` defaults to `false` (to match the default absence of `maxLength`).
  Pass down `true` to hide the character count if you've provided a `maxLength` but do not want it shown.
