# v9.0.0 Migration Guide

This version contains the following breaking changes:

1. The swatch rendered in `ColorPicker` (also used by `ColorInput`) is now a button
2. The tooltip rendered in the default `InputLabel` is now a button
3. The elements with [role="tab"] in `TabBar` switched from anchor tags to buttons

Further explanation of each item is detailed below.

## 1. The swatch rendered in `ColorPicker` (also used by `ColorInput`) is now a button
This change _might_ affect styling. Review to see if you have any rules targeting `.swatch` or `.cover`. In the case of the latter, this element is no longer being used (in preference to a third-party outside click library) and the styling rules should be able to be safely removed.

## 2. The tooltip rendered in the default `InputLabel` is now a button
This change will likely affect styling **if** you are using the `tooltip` prop on any inputs that don't already have a custom `labelComponent` defined. To preserve appropriate focus styling, move the `margin-left` styling from `.tooltip-trigger:after` to `.tooltip-trigger`. You will likely also need to strip the user agent's default button styling on `.tooltip-trigger`.

## 3. The elements with [role="tab"] in `TabBar` switched from anchor tags to buttons
This change _might_ affect styling. Review styling rules to see if there are any rules specifically targeting `a` elements. If so, replace those rules with a target of `[role="tab"]`. This is more resilient
