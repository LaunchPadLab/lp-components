## 1. Removed Recompose library

While this won't break any imported components (they have been updated to work without recompose), it will break any instance of directly importing `wrapDisplayName` from the `utils` folder.

To resolve this, remove that import and replace
```
wrapDisplayName(<component>, 'stringWrapper')
``` 
with an interpolated string:
```
`stringWrapper(${<component>.name})`
```
