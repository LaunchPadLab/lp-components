## 1. Upgraded Node version to 18.12.1

Typically, the Node version of an application can be updated without any breaking change. However, Node 18 requires an upgraded version of `glibc`. This has impact on Travis.

The default distribution used for builds and test execution (`xenial`) does not have the version of `glibc` required by Node 18. See this [Travis community forum note](https://travis-ci.community/t/the-command-npm-config-set-spin-false-failed-and-exited-with-1-during/12909) for a discussion of this issue. See this [Node issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42351#issuecomment-1068424442) for a discussion of the new `glibc` version requirement.

To resolve this issue, a specific Linux distribution (`focal`) is specified in the `.travis.yml` configuration file. This disribution has the correct `glibc` version. See [this Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/focal/) for a description of the `focal` build environment.

This version of `lp-components` will not support older Node versions. You must use Node version ^18.12.1.
