# v6.0.0 Migration Guide

This version introduces support for [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) versions ^14.19 and ^16.14. No `lp-components` interface changes were introduced in this version, though many of the underlying dependencies used to build the `lp-components` have been updated. This version also eliminates support for earlier Node versions. [Client template](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/client-template) version ^6.0.0 is compatible with this `lp-components` version.
