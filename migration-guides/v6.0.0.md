# v6.0.0 Migration Guide

This version introduces support for [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) versions of ^14.0.0 || ^16.0.0. Many of the underlying dependencies used to build `lp-components` have also been updated. This version also eliminates support for earlier Node releases that are no longer considered under "long-term support" by the Node.js team. This version is compatible with [Client template](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/client-template) version ^6.0.0.

As part of updating underlying dependencies, a very old version of react-router was removed from this library. This involved removing the following components: `<AuthorizedRoute />`, `<UnauthorizedRoute />`, and `<NavLink />`. The authorization routes relied on an API that has been deprecated since version 4 of react-router. Likewise, the NavLink component [exists natively in react-router v5](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/NavLink) and subsequently does not require the custom wrapper that this library provided.

If your application relied on the NavLink component, simply use the `NavLink` from react-router and apply the active class of `is-active`.

```jsx
// Before
import { NavLink } from 'lp-components'

<NavLink to="/">Home</NavLink>

// After
import { NavLink } from 'react-router'

<NavLink to="/" activeClassName="is-active">Home</NavLink>
```

If you need to implement authorized routes, follow the official example provided by react-router here: https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/example/auth-workflow. Alternatively, you can pull in the previous `<AuthorizedRoute />` and `<UnauthorizedRoute />` components locally from `v5` of this library if the application that you're working on intends to stay on `react-router@3`.
