# v4.0.0 Migration Guide

This version contains the following breaking changes:

1. `<Select />` now has a `placeholder` prop by default ("Select")
1. `<Button />` and `<SubmitButton />` now use `aria-disabled` instead of `disabled`
1. The `style` prop on `<Button />` and `<SubmitButton />` has been renamed to `variant`
1. Labels for `<CheckboxGroup />` and `<RadioGroup />` now use a `<legend>` html tag rather than a `<label>`

The required changes for each item are detailed below.

---

#### 1. `<Select />` now has a `placeholder` prop by default ("Select")

It's likely that you are already providing placeholders to each instance of `<Select />` in your application. However, if there are instances that must not have a placeholder, you can replicate this behavior in `v4` by passing a false `placeholder` prop:

```jsx
<Field name="foo" component={Select} options={[]} placeholder={false} />
```

#### 2. `<Button />` and `<SubmitButton />` now use `aria-disabled` instead of `disabled`

This change requires an update to stylesheets in your application to target `aria-disabled` rather than `disabled`:

Before:

```scss
button:disabled {
  // ...disabled styles
}
```

After

```scss
button[aria-disabled='true'] {
  // ...disabled styles
}
```

Note: this update likely won't be necessary in apps that use the LaunchPad Lab `client-template` since those styles target a common `.is-disabled` class.

#### 3. The `style` prop on `<Button />` and `<SubmitButton />` has been renamed to `variant`

Any `<Button />` and `<SubmitButton />` with a `style` prop should be updated to use `variant` instead.

Before:

```jsx
<Button style="secondary" />
```

After:

```jsx
<Button variant="secondary" />
```

_Hint: a global text search for `style="` should point you to where this update needs to happen._

#### 4. Labels for `<CheckboxGroup />` and `<RadioGroup />` now use a `<legend>` html tag rather than a `<label>`

To avoid visual regressions, make sure any global styles applied to `<label>` elements in your stylesheets also apply to `<legend>` elements.

Before:

```scss
label {
  // ...global label styles
}
```

After

```scss
label,
legend {
  // ...global label styles
}
```
